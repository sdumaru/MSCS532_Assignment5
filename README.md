# MSCS532_Assignment5
Assignment 5 of MSCS 532 course

## Quicksort: Implementation, Analysis and Randomization
This assignment explores the implementation and performance analysis of Deterministic Quicksort along with its randomized version. The aim is to analyze the performance of both deterministic and randomized versions under different conditions.

## Files
- 'quicksort.py' : Python implementation of Quicksort.
- 'Assignment5_Report.pdf' : Detailed report about the implementation, analysis, and comparisons of deterministic and randomized quicksort.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository using the command: git clone https://github.com/sdumaru/MSCS532_Assignment5.git
2. Make sure python is already installed in your system, otherwise download and install python.
3. Navigate to the repository directory: cd MSCS532_Assignment5
4. Run the code using the command: python .\quicksort.py

## Summary
This assignment demonstrates the efficiency of quicksort for sorting and how to improve its efficiency using the randomized version of quicksort. Both deterministic and randomized versions of Quicksort were successfully implemented and analyzed for their performance and scalibity.
